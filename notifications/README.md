## Getting Started

Install yarn:
```js
npm install -g yarn
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

Set environment (vars):
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Start server:
```sh
# Start server
yarn start

# Selectively set DEBUG env var to get logs
DEBUG=sabongmobile:* yarn start
```
Refer [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to know how to selectively turn on logs.


Tests:
```sh
# Run tests written in ES6 
yarn test

# Run tests on file change
yarn test:watch
```

Lint:
```sh
# Lint code with ESLint
yarn lint

# Run lint on any file change
yarn lint:watch
```

##### Deployment

```sh
# compile to ES5
1. yarn build

# upload dist/ to your server
2. scp -rp dist/ user@dest:/path

# install production dependencies only
3. yarn --production

# Use any process manager to start your services
4. pm2 start dist/index.js
```

In production you need to make sure your server is always up so you should ideally use any of the process manager recommended [here](http://expressjs.com/en/advanced/pm.html).
We recommend [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) as it has several useful features like it can be configured to auto-start your services if system is rebooted.
